# Pokémon National Pokédex Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the National Pokédex using R, focusing on 1025 Pokémon species. The goal is to explore key statistics, both numeric (HP, attack, defense, special defense, special attack and speed) and categorical (name, type, category and generation), in order to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the dataset.

### Environment:
This project has been developed using **R**, a powerful language for statistical computing and data analysis. Specifically, the development environment used is **RStudio**. To enhance the reproducibility and presentation of the analysis, we have utilized **Quarto** notebooks, a flexible tool that supports **LaTeX**. These tools have enabled us to present statistical formulas, concepts and results in a clean and easy-to-understand way. 

The combination of RStudio and Quarto provides a robust workflow for data exploration, model development, and documentation, ensuring that all steps of the analysis are well-documented and reproducible. All the code of the project is contained in the Quarto notebook, where it is directly executable. 

### Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes in-depth visualizations and statistical summaries to provide insights into various Pokémon categories, types, and their attributes.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizes techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify major patterns in the data.

- **Clustering**: Implements unsupervised learning methods like K-means clustering to group Pokémon based on their statistical similarities. 

- **Regression**: Applies regression models to understand relationships between different Pokémon attributes.

### Used Techniques:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- K-means an Hierarchical Clustering

- Regression Models (Multiple Lineal Regression, Logistic...)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying differences between groups.

This analysis helps to better understand the distribution of Pokémon attributes and can be extended to develop predictive models or further statistical studies.

### Results and scope
The results derived from the application of these techniques provide valuable insights into the mathematics behind the Pokémon games, a globally successful franchise that has captivated millions over the past few decades. Each chapter of the project includes a summary of conclusions, with practical examples demonstrating the outcomes.

Among other features, the project serves as a foundational tool for taking a first step into the development of an intelligent Pokémon recommender system, based on the above mentioned statistics. This outcome can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as building or optimizing Pokémon teams for in-game strategies.
